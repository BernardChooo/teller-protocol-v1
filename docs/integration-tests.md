# Integration Tests

This document describes how to setup a local environment properly in order to execute integration tests.
It includes:

- A local Ganache instance.
- A local TheGraph node.
- Finally, a subgraph deployed on the local TheGraph node (see details [here](https://thegraph.com/)).

## Required Repositories

Before describing the goals, please, check you already have cloned the following repositories:

- **[Smart contracts](https://github.com/Zero-Collateral/zero-collateral-v1):** *This is the current repository. It contains all the official smart contracts and configuration for all networks (including Ganache, mainnet and testnets) for the platform*.

  ```git clone https://github.com/Zero-Collateral/zero-collateral-v1.git```

- **[Subgraph](https://github.com/Zero-Collateral/subgraph.git):** *This repository is based on TheGraph protocol, and listens all the smart contract events, and save the data into a GraphQL server.*

  ```git clone https://github.com/Zero-Collateral/subgraph.git```

- **[Our own TheGraph node](https://github.com/Zero-Collateral/graph-node)**: *This repository is used to create a local TheGraph node using a script (.sh) file. So, it can be executed repeatedly without the need to remove the data generated in the Docker volume folders.*

  ```git clone https://github.com/Zero-Collateral/graph-node.git```

## Prerequisites

Before continuing with the next steps, please, check you already have completed:

- The *Get Started* steps detailed in [README.md](../README.md) file.
- The steps to clone the required repositories.

## Steps

The following steps will allow you to have:

- A local Ganache blockchain.
- A local TheGraph node.
- Our subgraph deployed on the local TheGraph node.

Finally, you will able to execute the integration tests (or scripts) on the local Ganache instance, and see the data on the deployed subgraph on TheGraph.

## Setup

1- Start a local Ganache instance (using Docker).

In a new command window, go to the folder where you cloned the *Smart Contract* repository (***this repository***), and execute:

```sh
yarn start:ganache:docker
```

As result, you should see:

![Start Ganache Using Docker](./images/integration-tests/yarn-start-ganache-docker.png)

> Please, **DON'T use** the pre-configured mnemonic in a production environment. It is **ONLY** for local testing purposes.

You already have a Ganache instance running locally.

2- Start a local TheGraph node.

In a new command window, go to the folder where you cloned the *Our own TheGraph node* repository, and within **graph-node/docker** folder execute:

```sh
./run-node-graph.sh
```

> It might ask you to type your password in the starting process. Just, type your password, and press Enter.

After some seconds, you should see:

![Start Ganache Using Docker](./images/integration-tests/start-thegraph-node.png)

3- Deploy the subgraph on the local TheGraph node.

In a new command window, go to the folder where you cloned the **Subgraph** repository, and in the **root** folder, execute:

```sh
yarn deploy:ganache
```

At the final of the process, you will deploy the subgraph on the TheGraph node locally pointing to your Ganache instance.

> You might see an error in the console with the following message:
>
> ```sh
> âœ– Error removing the subgraph: subgraph name not found: zero-collateral/subgraph
> error Command failed with exit code 1.
> ```
>
> Don't panic. This error is due to the process is trying to remove the subgraph, but it doesn't exist. It is used in a development mode (when you deploy it several times without restart the TheGraph node).

As result, you should see:

![Start Ganache Using Docker](./images/integration-tests/yarn_deploy_ganache.png)

Congrats! You already finished the configuration!

Now, you are ready to run the integration tests. In a new command window, go to the folder where you cloned the **Smart Contracts** repository, and in the **root** folder, execute::

```yarn test:ganache```

As result, you will see:

![Run Integration Tests](./images/integration-tests/run-integration-tests.png)

Now, you can click on the URL where the subgraph was deployed, and execute queries.

![TheGraph Localhost](./images/integration-tests/thegraph-localhost.png)

Enjoy it!
